# Retry Pattern

## Usage
This pattern is widely used in distributed systems and cloud environments where transient faults are common.

## Description
The Retry design pattern is a resilience strategy used to handle transient failures in a system by 
automatically retrying a failed operation. If the operation is idempotent its inherently safe to retry.


Key aspects:
* **Transient Fault Handling:** This pattern is particularly useful for handling temporary issues such as
  network timeouts or service unavailability, which are likely to resolve themselves if retried after a short delay.
* **Retry Logic:** The pattern involves retrying the failed operation a specified number of times, with a delay between
each attempt. If the operation still fails after the maximum number of retries, it is treated as a permanent failure.
* **Configurable Parameters:** The number of retries, the delay between retries, and the conditions under which retries
should be attempted can be configured based on the specific requirements of the application.
* **Improved Stability:** By transparently retrying failed operations, the pattern helps improve the stability and
reliability of the application, ensuring that transient faults do not disrupt the overall functionality.
