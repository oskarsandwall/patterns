# Backends for Frontends (BFF) Pattern

## Usage
This pattern helps avoid the complexities and bottlenecks that can arise from trying to 
customize a single backend to serve multiple frontends with different requirements.

## Description
This involves creating separate backend services for each frontend application or interface. 
This approach is particularly useful when different frontends (like web, mobile, or desktop applications) 
have unique requirements and need tailored backend services to optimize their performance and user experience.


Key aspects:
* **Customization:** Each frontend has its own backend, which is specifically designed to meet its unique needs. This allows for better optimization and performance.
* **Simplified Frontend Logic:** By handling complex data processing and logic on the backend, the frontend can remain simpler and more focused on the user interface.
* **Improved User Experience:** Tailored backends ensure that each frontend receives only the relevant data and logic, enhancing the overall user experience.
* **Autonomy:** Each frontend team can work independently on their backend, allowing for flexibility in development, deployment, and updates.
