# Builder Pattern

## Usage

## Description
The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to construct 
complex objects step by step. Itâ€™s particularly useful when creating objects with 
many attributes or configurations.


Here is an example in the form of a class diagram:

``` mermaid
classDiagram
    class Director {
        +construct(builder: Builder)
    }
    class Builder {
        +buildPartA()
        +buildPartB()
        +getResult(): Product
    }
    class ConcreteBuilderA {
        +buildPartA()
        +buildPartB()
        +getResult(): Product
    }
    class ConcreteBuilderB {
        +buildPartA()
        +buildPartB()
        +getResult(): Product
    }
    class Product {
        -partA
        -partB
        +assemble()
    }

    Director --> Builder : Uses
    Director --> ConcreteBuilderA : Uses
    Director --> ConcreteBuilderB : Uses
    ConcreteBuilderA --> Product : Creates
    ConcreteBuilderB --> Product : Creates

```

* Director coordinates the building process.
* Builder defines the construction steps.
* ConcreteBuilderA and ConcreteBuilderB implement the builder interface.
* Product represents the final complex object.
